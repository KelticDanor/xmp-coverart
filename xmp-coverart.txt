--------------------------------------------

Displays album art of the playing song in the 'Visuals' panel in XMPlay.

An automatic cover download feature is also included.

To run it, copy xmp-coverart.svp somewhere under the XMPlay directory and restart XMPlay.
In XMPlay press F9 (or select the Visuals panel), right click the window and
select the 'Cover Art' plugin from the list.

Supported are all image files found in the same directory as the song and all integrated images
in the ID3, FLAC or MP4/M4A tags of a playing audio file. Supported are the JPEG, PNG, BMP,
TGA, PSD and  GIF image formats. For songs in archives the cover images need to be in the
file tag or in a default cover image directory.

The configuration of the cover art can be accessed by pressing shift and clicking the
visuals screen. Alternatively it can be opened with a middle click.

You can then set up the following options:

 - Fade Album Art: Fading of all album changes. Should/could be disabled for bigger display.

 - Album Art alignment/stretch: Changes between different aligning and stretching options.

 - Auto cover downloader: When active, automatically downloads (and optionally saves) covers.


Notes:

 - Auto cycling through all available album art images is available in the 'Select Cover' menu.
   Can be customized by changing albumart_cycleseconds value in vis.ini under [coverart].

 - If saving of covers is enabled, the user can select a different cover after downloading 
   and chose 'Save selected downloaded cover' from the menu to keep one.

 - (Re)downloading can be done anytime by selecting 'Download now' in the menu to
   recheck covers or to select another one to save on disk.

 - Saving for covers coming from network streams or songs stored in archive files is available
   if a default save directory is enabled for the downloaded covers (check the menu option
   'auto save stream/archive' for that).

 - The plugin loads the file "cover.jpg" or "cover.png" from the same directory where the plugin
   SVP is stored as default cover image. If it does not exist, it shows the included image.
   It does the same for "download.jpg" or "download.png" to replace the image being displayed
   while the auto cover downloader is downloading.

[2019_08_29 - rev.8]

  Release source code, cleaned up internals, tested with Windows 10
  Fixed some of the auto cover downloading services, disabled all the others.


[2013_06_07 - rev.7]

  Fixed opening of fixed cover/download placeholder image files from the plugin directory.
  Also, I realized all auto cover downloading features are broken. No fix atm, sorry.


[2009_10_22 - rev.6]

  Fixed the internal sorting mechanism which selects the main shown cover image for embedded 
  cover album art. Before with MP4 files and some cases of embedded ID3/FLAC tag images
  it could prefer to show images in the same directory of the song file.
  Now embedded covers are always shown as the main image (first if cycling is enabled)

  Amazon cover lookup works again (they require some signing of webservice requests now)


[2009_07_29 - rev.5]

  Support for MP4/M4A files that store a cover art in the MP4 meta header data.
  Support for looking up images on Last.fm, Google Images and Flickr instead of Amazon.
  This 'mashup'-feature is kinda basic and almost a proof-of-concept and might contain bugs.


[2009_02_03 - rev.4]

  Support for Windows 9x \o/ (Unicode issues)


[2008_09_20 - 0.9.3]

  Better support for alpha channel in PNG files


[2008_08_07 - 0.9.2]

  More advanced MP4 image support. Now loads all JPEG/PNG images inside the file and even
  writes out time information for when the covers apply to the track (if they are timed).


[2008_08_05 - 0.9.1]

  Added support for images stored in MP4 (and M4A) files.


[2008_08_05 - 0.9.0]

  First version. Based very heavily on its predecessor XMPlay Vis Plugin 'winamp_svp'.
  Actually it has no new feature since winamp_svp 0.9.11 from 2008-07-29 except the removing
  of the winamp wrapping functionality. The winamp visualisation wrapping can now be found
  in the plugin xmp-WaVis.
